# Reports Alignment with Date-Based Ledger Balancing

## Overview

Updated the `ReportsController` to align with the recent date-based ledger balancing implementation. The reports now use the standardized `LedgerAccount::getCurrentBalance()` method instead of custom balance calculation logic.

## Problem Identified

The Reports controller had **custom balance calculation methods** that:

1. Duplicated the balance calculation logic from `LedgerAccount` model
2. Did not benefit from the date-based ledger balancing updates
3. Could produce inconsistent results compared to ledger account views
4. Did not leverage the model's caching and optimization features

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `calculateAccountBalance()` Method

**Before:**

```php
private function calculateAccountBalance($account, $asOfDate)
{
    // Custom calculation with 25+ lines of code
    $balance = $account->opening_balance ?? 0;
    $totalDebits = $account->voucherEntries()->whereHas(...)->sum('debit_amount');
    $totalCredits = $account->voucherEntries()->whereHas(...)->sum('credit_amount');

    if (in_array($account->account_type, ['asset', 'expense'])) {
        $balance = $balance + $totalDebits - $totalCredits;
    } else {
        $balance = $balance + $totalCredits - $totalDebits;
    }

    return $balance;
}
```

**After:**

```php
private function calculateAccountBalance($account, $asOfDate)
{
    // Use the model's getCurrentBalance method for consistency
    return $account->getCurrentBalance($asOfDate, false);
}
```

**Benefits:**

-   ✅ Single source of truth for balance calculation
-   ✅ Consistent with ledger account views
-   ✅ Leverages model optimizations
-   ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code
-   ✅ Automatically benefits from future model improvements

### 2. Updated `calculateAccountBalanceForPeriod()` Method

**Before:**

```php
private function calculateAccountBalanceForPeriod($account, $fromDate, $toDate)
{
    // Custom calculation showing only period activity
    $totalDebits = $account->voucherEntries()->whereHas(...)->sum('debit_amount');
    $totalCredits = $account->voucherEntries()->whereHas(...)->sum('credit_amount');

    if (in_array($account->account_type, ['asset', 'expense'])) {
        $balance = $totalDebits - $totalCredits;
    } else {
        $balance = $totalCredits - $totalDebits;
    }

    return $balance;
}
```

**After:**

```php
private function calculateAccountBalanceForPeriod($account, $fromDate, $toDate)
{
    // Calculate opening balance (day before period start)
    $openingDate = date('Y-m-d', strtotime($fromDate . ' -1 day'));
    $openingBalance = $account->getCurrentBalance($openingDate, false);

    // Calculate closing balance (end of period)
    $closingBalance = $account->getCurrentBalance($toDate, false);

    // Period movement is the difference
    $periodMovement = $closingBalance - $openingBalance;

    return $periodMovement;
}
```

**Benefits:**

-   ✅ Uses the same date-based logic as ledger account views
-   ✅ Consistent period movement calculations
-   ✅ Properly accounts for opening balances
-   ✅ Aligns with the stock movement pattern

## Impact on Reports

### 1. Profit & Loss Report (`profitLoss()`)

**What changed:**

-   Income and expense period balances now calculated using `getCurrentBalance()`
-   Period movement shows actual change during the selected date range

**Result:**

-   More accurate period-specific income and expense figures
-   Consistent with ledger account statements
-   Respects account type logic automatically

**Example:**

```
Period: 01-10-2025 to 15-10-2025

Sales Revenue:
- Opening (30-09-2025): ₦10,000,000
- Closing (15-10-2025): ₦12,500,000
- Period Income: ₦2,500,000 ✓ (shows in P&L)
```

### 2. Trial Balance Report (`trialBalance()`)

**What changed:**

-   Account balances now use `getCurrentBalance()` for both point-in-time and period modes
-   Opening balance properly calculated for period mode

**Result:**

-   Consistent balances across trial balance and ledger accounts
-   Accurate period-based trial balance
-   Proper handling of both `as_of_date` and `from_date/to_date` parameters

**Example:**

```
As of Date Mode (legacy):
- Uses getCurrentBalance(asOfDate)

Period Mode (new):
- Opening balance: getCurrentBalance(fromDate - 1 day)
- Period movement: closingBalance - openingBalance
```

### 3. Balance Sheet Report (`balanceSheet()` and `balanceSheetTable()`)

**What changed:**

-   Asset, liability, and equity balances use `getCurrentBalance()`
-   Retained earnings calculation uses consistent balance method

**Result:**

-   Accurate point-in-time financial position
-   Balances match ledger account views
-   Proper balance sheet equation validation

**Example:**

```
As of 15-10-2025:
Assets: ₦50,000,000 (via getCurrentBalance)
Liabilities: ₦20,000,000 (via getCurrentBalance)
Equity: ₦30,000,000 (via getCurrentBalance + retained earnings)
Balance Check: Assets = Liabilities + Equity ✓
```

### 4. Cash Flow Report (`cashFlow()`)

**What changed:**

-   Operating, investing, and financing activities use consistent period calculations
-   Opening and closing cash positions use `getCurrentBalance()`

**Result:**

-   Accurate cash flow statements
-   Period movements properly calculated
-   Reconciles with balance sheet cash positions

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Profit & Loss Consistency

1. Select a period (e.g., 01-10-2025 to 15-10-2025)
2. Check P&L report for revenue account
3. Navigate to that revenue account's ledger
4. Filter by same date range
5. **Verify:** Period movement in P&L matches period movement in ledger

### Test 2: Trial Balance Alignment

1. Generate trial balance as of 15-10-2025
2. Note balance for any account (e.g., Expenses)
3. Navigate to that account's ledger
4. Filter to same date (as_of_date = 15-10-2025)
5. **Verify:** Balances match exactly

### Test 3: Balance Sheet Accuracy

1. Generate balance sheet as of 22-10-2025
2. Note asset account balance (e.g., Cash)
3. Navigate to cash ledger account
4. Check balance as of 22-10-2025
5. **Verify:** Balances match exactly

### Test 4: Historical Consistency

1. Generate P&L for past period (01-09-2025 to 30-09-2025)
2. Generate P&L for current period (01-10-2025 to 22-10-2025)
3. Compare with ledger account period movements
4. **Verify:** All period calculations consistent

**Performance:**

-   May be slightly faster due to model optimizations
-   Cache can be enabled for current balances if needed
-   Historical queries still disable cache for accuracy

## Future Enhancements

With this alignment, future improvements to `LedgerAccount::getCurrentBalance()` will automatically benefit all reports:

1. **Caching Strategy:** Smart caching for frequently accessed balances
2. **Bulk Calculations:** Batch processing for multiple accounts
3. **Optimization:** Index improvements, query optimizations
4. **Features:** Multi-currency support, consolidation, etc.

## Summary

The Reports controller is now fully aligned with the date-based ledger balancing system:

-   ✅ All reports use `LedgerAccount::getCurrentBalance()`
-   ✅ Period calculations use opening/closing balance method
-   ✅ Consistent with ledger account views
-   ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code
-   ✅ Ready for future enhancements

Users can now trust that report balances **always match** ledger account balances for any given date or period.
