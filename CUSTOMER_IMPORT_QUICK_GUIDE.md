-   **debit** - Customer owes you money (Accounts Receivable)
-   **credit** - You owe customer money (Customer Credit)

### 2. Customer Type Selection

-   **individual** - For personal customers (requires first_name + last_name)
-   **business** - For company customers (requires company_name)

### 3. Data Validation

-   Emails must be unique across all customers in your tenant
-   Phone numbers can be in any format
-   Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-01-15)
-   Currency codes should be 3 letters (NGN, USD, EUR, GBP)

### 4. Best Practices

-   Always download fresh template before importing
-   Keep a backup of your customer data
-   Test with 2-3 customers first before bulk import
-   Review error messages carefully for failed rows
-   Don't include duplicate emails in the same file

### 5. Performance

-   Small imports (< 100 customers): Very fast (< 5 seconds)
-   Medium imports (100-1000 customers): 10-60 seconds
-   Large imports (1000+ customers): Consider splitting into batches
