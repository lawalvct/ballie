```

## üéØ Reconciliation Workflow

### Step 1: Create Reconciliation

1. User selects bank account
2. Enters statement period (start/end date)
3. Enters closing balance per bank statement
4. System automatically loads unreconciled transactions

### Step 2: Match Transactions

1. System displays all transactions in period
2. User marks each transaction as:
    - **Cleared**: Transaction appears on bank statement
    - **Uncleared**: Transaction not yet on statement
    - **Excluded**: Transaction to be ignored
3. Real-time progress tracking

### Step 3: Reconcile Differences

-   System compares bank balance vs book balance
-   Shows difference amount
-   User can add adjustments:
    -   Bank charges
    -   Interest earned
    -   Other adjustments

### Step 4: Complete

-   When balanced (difference = 0), user can mark as completed
-   Updates bank's `last_reconciliation_date` and `last_reconciled_balance`
-   Locks reconciliation from further edits

## üìä Key Features

### Balance Calculation

-   **Opening Balance**: From ledger account
-   **Closing Balance (Books)**: Current ledger balance
-   **Closing Balance (Bank)**: From bank statement
-   **Difference**: Automatically calculated

### Transaction Matching

-   Loads all posted voucher entries for period
-   Links to voucher details
-   Shows debit/credit amounts
-   Clearance date tracking
-   Bank reference number support

### Status Management

-   **Draft**: Initial state, can be edited/deleted
-   **In Progress**: Active reconciliation
-   **Completed**: Locked, cannot edit
-   **Cancelled**: Cancelled reconciliation

### Statistics Tracking

-   Total transactions
-   Reconciled (cleared) transactions
-   Unreconciled transactions
-   Progress percentage

## üîÑ Next Steps to Complete

### Remaining Views Needed:

1. **create.blade.php** - Reconciliation creation form
2. **show.blade.php** - Reconciliation detail view with transaction matching interface

### Additional Features to Implement:

1. **AJAX Transaction Matching**: Real-time status updates without page refresh
2. **Bulk Actions**: Mark multiple transactions as cleared/uncleared
3. **Auto-match**: Smart matching based on amount/date
4. **Export**: PDF/Excel export of reconciliation report
5. **Statement Import**: Import bank statement CSV for auto-matching

### Integration Points:

1. Add "Reconcile" button to bank account show page
2. Display reconciliation status on banks index page
3. Show unreconciled item count in dashboard
4. Add reconciliation history to bank account details

## üìù Usage Instructions

### Run Migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Access Reconciliations:

Navigate to: `/banking/reconciliations`

### Create New Reconciliation:

1. Click "New Reconciliation"
2. Select bank account
3. Enter statement details
4. System loads transactions automatically

### View Reconciliation:

-   See all transactions for period
-   Mark as cleared/uncleared
-   View real-time progress
-   Complete when balanced

## üé® Design Patterns Used

-   **Emerald Color Theme**: Matches banking module (emerald-600, emerald-100)
-   **Card-based Layout**: Clean, organized sections
-   **Status Badges**: Color-coded for quick identification
-   **Statistics Cards**: Dashboard-style overview
-   **Responsive Grid**: Works on mobile and desktop
-   **Empty States**: Clear CTAs when no data

## üîó Model Relationships

```
Tenant ‚Üí BankReconciliation ‚Üí Bank
                             ‚Üí BankReconciliationItems ‚Üí VoucherEntry ‚Üí Voucher
```

## üöÄ Ready to Use

The core bank reconciliation system is now functional. Users can:

-   Create reconciliations
-   View reconciliation list
-   Filter by bank/status/date
-   See statistics dashboard

**Note**: create.blade.php and show.blade.php views need to be created to enable full reconciliation workflow with transaction matching interface.
