### 2. Validation Logging

**Validation Phase:**

-   Logs when validation fails with detailed error messages
-   Logs when validation passes successfully

### 3. Transaction Logging

**Database Operations:**

-   Logs when transaction starts
-   Logs voucher type retrieval with full details
-   Logs each inventory item processing with product details
-   Logs running total calculations
-   Logs voucher number generation logic
-   Logs voucher creation data before insert

-   Logs customer ledger account ID being used
-   Logs successful completion of accounting entries

### 5. Stock Update Logging

**Inventory Management:**

-   Logs when stock update is skipped (draft or none effect)

### 6. Transaction Commit Logging

**Final Steps:**

-   Logs successful database transaction commit
-   Logs complete success with voucher details
-   Logs redirect route and success message

### 7. Error Logging (Enhanced)

**Exception Handling:**

-   Logs detailed error information:
    -   Error message
    -   File where error occurred
    -   Line number
    -   Full stack trace
    -   Tenant ID
    -   User ID
    -   Complete request data (except token)
-   Improved error message returned to user (now includes actual error)

## How to Use Logs for Debugging

### 1. View Logs

Check Laravel log file:

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Or on Windows:

```bash
Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Wait -Tail 50
```

### 2. Filter Logs

Search for specific invoice creation:

```bash
grep "INVOICE STORE" storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Search for errors only:

```bash
grep "INVOICE STORE FAILED" storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### 3. Identify Issue Points

**If validation fails:**

-   Check "Validation Failed" log entry
-   Review validation errors array
-   Verify request data is complete

**If voucher creation fails:**

-   Check last successful log point
-   Review "Creating Voucher with Data" entry
-   Verify all required fields are present

**If accounting entries fail:**

-   Check "Creating Accounting Entries" log
-   Verify customer_ledger_id exists
-   Check if Sales ledger account exists

**If stock update fails:**

-   Check "Updating Product Stock" log
-   Verify products have maintain_stock = true
-   Check inventory_effect configuration

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Validation Failing

**Log Indicators:**

-   "Validation Failed" log appears
-   No "Database Transaction Started" log

**Solution:**

-   Check validation errors in log
-   Verify all required fields in request
-   Check customer_id format (should be ledger account ID)

### Issue 2: Voucher Not Created

**Log Indicators:**

-   "Creating Voucher with Data" appears
-   No "Voucher Created Successfully" log
-   "INVOICE STORE FAILED" appears

**Solution:**

-   Check error message for database constraints
-   Verify tenant_id is valid
-   Check voucher_type_id exists
-   Verify user is authenticated (created_by)

### Issue 3: Accounting Entries Failing

**Log Indicators:**

-   "Creating Accounting Entries" appears
-   No "Accounting Entries Created Successfully"
-   Error about "Required ledger accounts not found"

**Solution:**

-   Ensure Sales ledger account exists
-   Verify customer ledger account ID is valid
-   Check tenant_id matches for all accounts

### Issue 4: Stock Not Updating

**Log Indicators:**

-   "Stock Update Skipped" log appears
-   OR no stock update logs at all

**Solution:**

-   Check if invoice was saved as draft (stock only updates on post)
-   Verify inventory_effect is set on voucher type
-   Check products have maintain_stock = true
-   Verify StockMovement model relationship

### Issue 5: Transaction Rollback

**Log Indicators:**

-   Multiple logs appear but "Transaction Committed" never shows
-   "INVOICE STORE FAILED" with stack trace

**Solution:**

-   Review stack trace for exact error location
-   Check database constraints (foreign keys, unique indexes)
-   Verify all relationships exist (products, accounts, etc.)

## Example Log Output

### Successful Invoice Creation

```log
[2025-10-19 14:30:15] local.INFO: === INVOICE STORE STARTED === {"tenant_id":1,"tenant_slug":"demo","user_id":1,"timestamp":"2025-10-19 14:30:15"}
[2025-10-19 14:30:15] local.INFO: Request Data Received {"action":"save_and_post","voucher_type_id":"5","customer_id":"23","inventory_items_count":2}
[2025-10-19 14:30:15] local.INFO: Validation Passed Successfully
[2025-10-19 14:30:15] local.INFO: Database Transaction Started

[2025-10-19 14:30:15] local.INFO: === INVOICE STORE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY === {"voucher_id":156,"status":"posted","total_amount":"1200.00"}
```

### Failed Invoice Creation

```log
[2025-10-19 14:35:20] local.INFO: === INVOICE STORE STARTED === {"tenant_id":1,"user_id":1}
[2025-10-19 14:35:20] local.INFO: Request Data Received {"customer_id":"999","inventory_items_count":1}
[2025-10-19 14:35:20] local.INFO: Validation Passed Successfully
[2025-10-19 14:35:20] local.INFO: Database Transaction Started
[2025-10-19 14:35:20] local.ERROR: === INVOICE STORE FAILED === {"error_message":"Required ledger accounts not found","error_file":"InvoiceController.php","error_line":650,"tenant_id":1}
```

## Performance Impact

### Log File Size

-   Each invoice creation adds approximately 20-30 log entries
-   Average 2-3 KB per invoice creation
-   Monitor log file size in production
-   Implement log rotation if needed

### Processing Time

-   Minimal impact (< 5ms per request)
-   Logging is asynchronous in Laravel
-   No noticeable performance degradation

## Production Considerations

### Log Level Configuration

Current: All logs use `Log::info()` and `Log::error()`

For production, consider:

```php
// In .env file
LOG_LEVEL=warning  // Only errors and warnings
```

Or conditionally log:

```php
if (config('app.debug')) {
    Log::info('Detailed debug info');
}
```

### Log Rotation

Configure in `config/logging.php`:

```php
'daily' => [
    'driver' => 'daily',
    'path' => storage_path('logs/laravel.log'),
    'level' => 'debug',
    'days' => 14,  // Keep logs for 14 days
],
```

### Log Monitoring

Consider implementing:

-   Log aggregation tools (Papertrail, Loggly)
-   Real-time monitoring (Sentry, Bugsnag)
-   Custom alerts for "INVOICE STORE FAILED"

## Testing the Logs

### Test Scenario 1: Successful Creation

1. Create invoice with valid data
2. Check logs for "COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY"
3. Verify all intermediate steps logged

### Test Scenario 2: Validation Error

1. Submit invoice without required field
2. Check logs for "Validation Failed"
3. Verify errors array contains field names

### Test Scenario 3: Database Error

1. Use invalid customer_id
2. Check logs for detailed error message
3. Verify stack trace is logged

### Test Scenario 4: Stock Update

1. Create posted invoice
2. Check logs for "Updating Product Stock"
3. Verify "Product Stock Updated Successfully"

## Maintenance

### Regular Review

-   Weekly: Review failed invoice logs
-   Monthly: Analyze common error patterns
-   Quarterly: Update logging strategy if needed

### Log Cleanup

```bash
# Delete logs older than 30 days
find storage/logs -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Count successful vs failed invoices today
grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "INVOICE STORE" | wc -l
```

## Conclusion

The comprehensive logging added to the invoice store function provides visibility into every step of the invoice creation process, making it much easier to identify and debug issues when invoices fail to save.
