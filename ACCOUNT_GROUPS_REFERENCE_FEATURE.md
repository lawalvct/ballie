# Account Groups Reference Export Feature

## Enhancement Summary

Added a new feature to help users during ledger accounts import by providing a downloadable reference file showing all available account groups with their account types.

## Implementation Date

October 19, 2025

## Problem Solved

When importing ledger accounts, users need to know:

-   What account groups exist in their system
-   The exact names of account groups to use
-   Which account type (asset/liability/income/expense/equity) matches each group
-   The nature/category of each account group

Previously, users had to manually check the system or guess account group names, leading to import errors.

## Solution

Created a downloadable Excel reference file that shows all active account groups with:

1. **Account Group Name** - Exact name to use in import
2. **Group Code** - Internal code reference
3. **Nature** - Category (assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses)
4. **Account Type** - The account_type value to use (asset, liability, equity, income, expense)
5. **Description** - Purpose of the account group

## Files Created

**File**: `app/Exports/AccountGroupsReferenceExport.php` (106 lines)

## Example Output

| Current Assets      | CA         | Assets      | asset                | Short-term assets |
