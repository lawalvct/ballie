# ‚úÖ Customer Opening Balance Feature - Implementation Complete

## üìã Summary

Successfully implemented the ability to add opening balances for customers during creation. This feature allows users to import existing customer balances when migrating from other systems or setting up accounts with historical data.

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **User Interface** (`resources/views/tenant/crm/customers/create.blade.php`)

-   Added Opening Balance section in Financial Information (Section 5)
-   Three input fields:
    -   **Amount**: Numeric field for balance amount (always positive)
    -   **Type**: Dropdown with options:
        -   None (No Opening Balance)
        -   Debit (Customer Owes You)
        -   Credit (You Owe Customer)
    -   **Date**: Date picker for opening balance date
-   Visual design: Blue-highlighted section with icon and helpful descriptions
-   JavaScript validation for field synchronization

### 2. **Backend Logic** (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/Crm/CustomerController.php`)

-   Updated `store()` method with:
    -   Validation for opening balance fields
    -   Database transaction support
    -   Call to create opening balance voucher
-   New `createOpeningBalanceVoucher()` method that:
    -   Creates Journal Voucher (JV)
    -   Creates appropriate debit/credit entries
    -   Links to Opening Balance Equity account
    -   Updates ledger account balances

### 3. **Documentation**

-   Technical documentation: `CUSTOMER_OPENING_BALANCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
-   User guide: `docs/CUSTOMER_OPENING_BALANCE_GUIDE.md`
-   Test script: `test_customer_opening_balance.php`

## üîß Technical Details

### Accounting Logic

**For Debit Balance** (Customer owes you):

```
Dr. Customer Ledger Account         $X,XXX
    Cr. Opening Balance Equity              $X,XXX
```

**For Credit Balance** (You owe customer):

```
Dr. Opening Balance Equity          $X,XXX
    Cr. Customer Ledger Account             $X,XXX
```

### Database Impact

-   Uses existing tables (no migration needed):
    -   `customers`
    -   `ledger_accounts`
    -   `vouchers`
    -   `voucher_entries`

### Key Features

-   ‚úÖ Transaction-safe (DB transactions)
-   ‚úÖ Auto-creates Opening Balance Equity account if missing
-   ‚úÖ Validates all inputs
-   ‚úÖ Supports AJAX (quick add modal)
-   ‚úÖ Error handling and logging

### For Developers:

$request->opening_balance_amount = 5000.00;
$request->opening_balance_type = 'debit';
$request->opening_balance_date = '2025-01-01';

// Controller creates:
// 1. Customer record
// 2. Ledger account
// 3. Journal voucher (if amount > 0)
// 4. Voucher entries (Dr/Cr based on type)
```
